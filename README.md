Live Link: [Work Day Scheduler](https://paragasr.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/)

THis web app will allow the user to plan out their work day. It will display the current day and time at the top of the screen for the user, just for ease of access. The table shows the normal work hours, but can be editted to fit the user's work hours within the code. The user will be able to type in the spaces provided and plan out their day. If the tab is closed or reloaded, the data will restore to what it was when it was when saved. The user can save the content by clicking on the blue button with the save icon on it.
